## Purpose

This code calculates detection limits for the AA500 Nutrient Analyzer in the Bergstrom Biogeochem Lab using the following equation:

$$Detection Limit = 3.3*sigma/m$$

where sigma is the standard deviation of the residuals (the difference in observed results from linear model)

and m=slope of calibration curve

## Load Data

1.  Update the working directory to the folder that your export data lives in.
2.  Ensure that your correct calibration export .csv files are associated with "cat" and "an"

```{r}
setwd("/Users/hannahrichardson/Documents/BSU/Research/Data/Raw Data/Nutrient Analyzer")
list.files()

data <- read.csv("nox_silcate_wolv_10_Oct_22.csv")

numchan<- 2 #this is the number of channels run, make sure it matches your run
```

## Use DL function

All results are in mg/L

```{r}
AA500_detectionlimit(data,numchan)
```
